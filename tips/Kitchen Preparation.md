If you need to handle emergencies or long-term home needs, it is also recommended to purchase the following:

```text
Refrigerator, microwave, plastic wrap, ziplock bags
Eggs, green peppers, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, wood ear mushrooms, tenderloin, eggplants, rice, noodles or instant noodles
```

If you really want to pursue formalization, standardization, and ritual, and want to have a unique and interesting kitchen, then also purchase the following:

```text

```

If you want to save time, you can buy semi-finished products and eat them after simple processing:

```text
Pre-fried fried chicken nuggets, frozen hand-pulled pancakes, packaged dumplings, packaged curry, various donburi (rice bowls), self-heating food, noodle seasoning packets, takeout packages, convenience food
```

For other raw materials specific to each dish, please refer to the `Required Raw Materials` section of the dish itself.

## Oil Selection

Before selecting oil, you need to understand some basic knowledge of fatty acids.

### Classification of Fatty Acids

Fatty acids are divided into:

* Saturated fatty acids (try to avoid)
* Unsaturated fatty acids
  * Cis fatty acids
  * Trans fatty acids (especially avoid)
  * Polyunsaturated fatty acids
  * Monounsaturated fatty acids

Saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature.

### Fatty Acids to Avoid

Among them, **saturated fatty acids** and **trans fatty acids** are generally considered unhealthy.

Saturated fatty acids increase the risk of obesity, high cholesterol, and heart disease.

Studies show that long-term excessive consumption of trans fatty acids produced by hydrogenation can cause abnormal lipid metabolism in the body, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Some studies also show it may increase the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.

The World Health Organization recommends: To promote cardiovascular health, control trans fatty acids in the diet, with a maximum intake not exceeding 1% of total energy. That is, if an adult averages 2000 kcal of energy intake per day, the daily intake of trans fatty acids should not exceed 2.2 grams.

GB 28050-2011 stipulates that when food ingredients contain or use hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated oils in the production process, the trans fat (acid) content should also be indicated in the nutrition facts table.

### Trans Fatty Acids in Food

According to relevant surveys, the average trans fatty acid content in baked goods (cakes, cookies, bread, etc.), seasonings, and fried foods is between 0.30~0.50 g/100g.

Therefore, there is no need to worry too much—trans fatty acids in daily food are not enough to harm health. But to be safe, when purchasing snacks, you might as well pay attention to the `trans fat (acid)` content marked in the nutrition facts table.

### Trans Fatty Acids in Cooking

According to a 2021 survey, the average trans fatty acid content in China's vegetable oils is 0.86 g/100g, no need to worry too much.

The additional source of trans fatty acids to pay attention to is the cooking process:

Vegetable oils often contain a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have poor thermal stability and are easily converted to trans fatty acids at high temperatures.

Therefore, in different scenarios, we need to reasonably choose oils and minimize the heating time of oils as much as possible.

### Vegetable Oil Selection

| Oil Name | Saturated Fatty Acids (%) | Omega 3 (%) | Omega 6 (%) | Omega 9 (%) |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Canola oil | 7% | 11% | 21% | 61% |
| Flaxseed oil | 9% | 57% | 16% | 18% |
| Sunflower oil | 12% | 1% | 71% | 16% |
| Corn oil | 13% | 1% | 57% | 29% |
| Olive oil | 15% | 1% | 9% | 75% |
| Soybean oil | 15% | 8% | 54% | 23% |
| Peanut oil | 19% | 0% | 33% | 48% |
| Cottonseed oil | 27% | 0% | 54% | 19% |
| Lard | 43% | 1% | 9% | 47% |
| Palm oil | 51% | 0% | 10% | 39% |
| Beef tallow | 68% | 1% | 3% | 28% |
| Coconut oil | 91% | 0% | 2% | 7% |

* `Peanut oil` is rich in `monounsaturated fats`. But only high-quality ones are recommended. Also, pay attention not to heat for too long to avoid producing `trans fatty acids`.
* `Olive oil` is rich in `monounsaturated fats`, with only one unsaturated bond. Olive oil has low `saturated fatty acid` content. But only high-quality ones are recommended. Also, pay attention not to heat for too long to avoid producing trans fatty acids.
* `Soybean oil` has no `saturated fatty acids`, and contains linoleic acid, vitamins. But soybean oil is unstable, easily produces `trans fatty acids` during processing, so not recommended for long-term consumption, can be used for cold dishes.
* `Rapeseed oil` has good thermal stability, rich in `polyunsaturated fatty acids`, but may contain erucic acid, which may cause fat deposition and heart damage. Rapeseed oil lacks linoleic acid, has low nutritional value, and is prone to spoilage.
* `Coconut oil` has very high `saturated fatty acids`, good thermal stability, but note that some foods use hydrogenated coconut oil. Suitable for frying in the kitchen, frequent consumption increases obesity risk.
* `Palm oil` has very high `saturated fatty acids`, good thermal stability, frequent consumption increases high cholesterol risk.
* `Lard`, `beef tallow` and other animal fats are rich in `saturated fatty acids`, frequent consumption increases high cholesterol risk. Not recommended for long-term consumption.

Therefore, based on the above table, we can draw some conclusions:

* No oil is perfect, each has its advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, we should choose different oils according to different cooking scenarios.
* We should not always use the same type of oil, but choose different oils according to different cooking scenarios to ensure nutritional balance.
* To avoid ingesting too much `trans fatty acids`. When heating, do not choose thermally unstable oils, do not heat for too long.
* Do not eat fried foods in large quantities. Oils with good thermal stability often contain a lot of `saturated fatty acids`, not suitable for long-term consumption.
* Do not reuse oils. Oils produce a lot of `trans fatty acids` during heating.
* Do not eat takeout food for a long time, because it's hard to determine what oils they used.

#### Stir-Fry Oil

* Peanut oil (choose high quality)
* Olive oil (choose high quality)
* Rapeseed oil (choose low erucic acid)

Peanut oil, olive oil, rapeseed oil contain more unsaturated fatty acids, less saturated fatty acids. But their thermal stability is poor, easily produce trans fatty acids during heating. Therefore, pay attention to control heating time, do not heat for too long.

#### Frying Oil

* Coconut oil
* Palm oil
* Beef tallow
* Lard

For stir-frying, deep-frying, use oils with better thermal stability, such as: coconut oil, palm oil, beef tallow. They produce less trans fatty acids. However, their saturated fatty acid content is higher, not suitable for long-term consumption.

#### Cold Dish, Stewing Oil

* Flaxseed oil
* Sesame oil
* Walnut oil
* Perilla oil

These scenarios do not require heating, so no trans fatty acids are produced. Do not choose oils with too much saturated fatty acids.
