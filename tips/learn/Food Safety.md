# Food Safety

## Poisoning

The following foods have risk of causing poisoning:

* Unripe green tomatoes
* Undercooked green beans (kidney beans), yard-long beans (string beans), [white kidney beans](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E5%88%80%E8%B1%86)
* Sprouted potatoes (yam), sweet potatoes, peanuts
* Incorrectly processed/undercooked [daylily](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BB%84%E8%8A%B1%E8%8F%9C) can lead to [colchicine](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A7%8B%E6%B0%B4%E4%BB%99%E7%B4%A0) poisoning
* Raw soy milk
* Wood ear soaked too long (not just wood ear, all fungi soaked too long have poisoning risk)
* Uncooked animal offal
* Unrecognized mushrooms or uncooked mushrooms (there is a proverb: red umbrella, white pole, eat and lie on board together. Generally, the prettier the mushroom, the more dangerous.)
* …… (welcome to add)

Acidic foods stored & cooked in aluminum containers for long time also have poisoning risk, such as

* Sauerkraut
* Bamboo shoots
* Tomato sauce
* Lemon juice
* Braised meat
* Soy sauce and pickles
* …… (welcome to add)

## Allergy

The following are common allergic foods (note: allergic reactions are generally lifelong):

Adults:

* Shrimp, crab, shellfish (eating stale seafood leading to bacterial growth)
* Peanuts
* Nuts
* Fish

Children:

* Peanuts
* Nuts
* Eggs
* Milk (mainly intolerance to A1 protein in milk)
* Wheat and soybeans

## Salmonella Infection

Salmonella is more common in animal-derived foods, including vegetables may contain salmonella due to fecal contamination.

The following foods have risk of causing salmonella infection:

* Undercooked eggs
* Undercooked meat
* Unpasteurized milk

## Aflatoxin

Aflatoxin is produced by Aspergillus flavus and several other molds in moldy grains, such as rice, beans, peanuts, etc., and is the strongest carcinogen so far. It starts to decompose when heated above 280°C, so general heating does not easily destroy its structure.

The following foods have risk of causing aflatoxin poisoning:

* Spoiled peanuts
* Spoiled rice
* Spoiled corn

Note, the above foods also include their corresponding products, such as rice flour, cornmeal; safely cultivated peanut sprouts (sprouted peanuts) can be considered safe to eat.

## 3-Nitropropanoic Acid

3-Nitropropanoic acid is produced by Arthrinium saccharicola, this fungus commonly parasitizes sugarcane, coconut. The main manifestation of poisoning is central nervous system damage. Acute symptoms include vomiting, dizziness, paroxysmal convulsions, lateral gaze, coma, even death, sequelae mainly damage to extrapyramidal system, main symptoms include flexion, torsion, spasm, limb stiffness, reduced tension at rest, etc. There is no specific antidote for this toxin.

The following foods have risk of causing 3-nitropropanoic acid poisoning:

* Red sugarcane
* [Spoiled coconut](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w84y147TU)

Besides visual appearance as judgment standard, smell is also important evaluation standard. Spoiled plants often emit special smells (lees smell, sour smell, etc.). The best way to handle smelly spoiled food is to discard.

## Parasites

Parasites can enter the human body through air, drinking water, food and direct contact. If parasites enter the human circulatory system, on one hand they can attack white blood cells, on the other hand they can reach lungs, liver and other organs or block blood vessels or lymphatic ducts, causing diseases such as cirrhosis, portal hypertension, elephantiasis. If a person is the intermediate host of Taenia solium, parasites can even reach the eyeball, heart and brain, endangering life.

The following foods should be ensured fully cooked, otherwise may leave corresponding parasites in the body:

* Snail: Angiostrongylus cantonensis
* Sashimi: Liver fluke
* Eel: Gnathostoma
* Bullfrog: Sparganum mansoni
* Pork: Taenia solium
* Beef surface (as long as surface is cooked can eat): Taenia saginata

## Food Safety Temperature

By heating food to sufficient temperature and maintaining for a certain time, can to a certain extent reduce risk of bacteria, parasite survival.
Various foods have different temperature requirements, cooks should use kitchen thermometer to measure food center temperature.

Measure temperature should use: kitchen thermometer
Measure food center temperature

The following are industry standard food safety temperatures:

|           | Whole Piece                                   | Ground Meat | Whole Bird |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Pork      | 71°C                                         | 71°C        |           |
| Poultry   | 74°C                                         | 74°C        | 85°C      |
| Beef/Lamb | Rare: 63°C; Medium: 71°C; Well-done: 77°C    | 71°C        |           |
| Leftover Reheat | 74°C                                       |             |           |
