# Steaming (Rice)/Stewing (Using Rice Cooker/Pressure Cooker/Electric Pressure Cooker)

## What is Pressure Cooker

Pressure cooker is actually a general pot plus a lockable semi-sealed lid, lid has valve, can be used to control pressure inside pot.

### Working Method

Pressure cooker's working method is to let steam accumulate in pot, increase pressure inside pot. When pot pressure increases, water boiling point also increases, can make water-containing food cooking temperature exceed 100°C.

### Advantages

* Since pressure cooker's actual cooking temperature is higher, can greatly shorten cooking time.
* High temperature inside pressure cooker can promote browning and caramelization, able to produce unique flavor.

## Process

* Put ingredients and water into inner pot then close lid, **ensure pot body sealed**, heat.
* For tougher ingredients, such as tendon foods, using pressure cooker can easily cook them soft, obtain better texture.
* Pressure cooker usually has a self-locking valve (float valve). During steaming, as pot pressure increases, self-locking valve will activate and lock, isolate pot inside and outside gas, create conditions for pot pressurization. After self-locking valve activates, will also lock pot lid, prevent forced opening, play safety guarantee role. During steaming need to confirm self-locking valve not blocked by foreign objects, let pressure cooker work normally.
* After switching to keep warm state, **through exhaust valve release pot steam then can open lid**.

### Precautions

* **Steam is very hot, don't lean on exhaust valve.**
* During cooking **liquid foods**, **do not manually exhaust**, careful of splashing (can put ingredients into sealed can or vacuum bag then use pressure cooker to cook).
* Cooking some cuisines (such as soups) manual exhaust **may affect food flavor and texture**.
* Before opening lid need confirm steam already released. When opening lid do not open all at once, especially **do not open lid facing people**, to avoid steam burn.
* After cooking, as pressure cooker internal pressure decreases to balance with external pressure, self-locking valve will loosen. This can be used as judgment sign whether lid can be opened.
* Pressure cooker's sealing relies on sealing rubber ring in lid, for old pressure cookers need to check if sealing rubber ring still effective.
* Confirm rubber ring completely clean, any particles stuck in it may destroy sealed environment.
* Many pressure cookers have a safety line, materials and liquids should not exceed this line, too many ingredients and liquids may let steam gush block exhaust valve, or splash out too much steam hard to clean.
* Pressure cookers without safety line, best also not let water level exceed pot body's 2/3.
* **Do not use pressure cooker to cook oatmeal or noodles etc. foods that easily produce foam**. Foam may block steam valve and pressure relief pipe.
* During cooking, when pressure valve rises and sprays steam or smoke, indicates pressure cooker internal over-pressurized, pressure valve to ensure safety, released excess pressure. Although sprayed steam has rich aroma brings high pleasure, but one food flavor has loss, two over-pressurization may bend slots of some types pressure cooker. Therefore when see spraying steam, can reduce fire.
* Tips: Opening lid from side is a good choice.
