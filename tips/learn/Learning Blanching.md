## Operation

### Boiling Water Pot Blanching

Boiling water pot blanching is heating the water in the pot, then putting in the ingredients. After putting in, stir in time, time should be short, don't overcook.

This method is mostly used for plant ingredients, such as: celery, spinach, lettuce, etc. When blanching, pay special attention to heat, if time is a bit long, color will fade, and not crisp, tender. So after putting in pot, when water slightly boils, can scoop out and cool.

- Leafy vegetable ingredients should be blanched first then sliced, to avoid excessive loss of nutrients.
- When blanching, water should be ample and fire strong, so that after putting in ingredients, can timely boil; when blanching green leafy vegetables, should slightly roll then scoop out.
- Vegetable ingredients after blanching should immediately plunge into cold water and drain, to avoid yellowing or overcooking due to residual heat.
- Vegetable blanching can add appropriate amount of salad oil such as peanut oil, corn oil, soybean oil to keep green.

### Cold Water Pot Blanching

Cold water pot blanching is putting ingredients and cold water in pot at the same time. Water should submerge ingredients, then boil, purpose is to make ingredients cooked, convenient for further processing.

Potatoes, carrots, etc., because volume is large, not easy to cook, need longer boiling time.

Some animal ingredients, such as: white meat, beef tripe, beef stomach, etc., also cold water in pot, heat to cooked then further process. Some animal ingredients used for soup also cold water in pot, during heating make nutrients gradually overflow, make soup delicious, if use hot water pot, will cause protein coagulation.

- Water added in pot should not be too much, submerge ingredients is enough.
- During gradual heating, must frequently turn ingredients, to make ingredients heat evenly, achieve blanching purpose.

## Additional Precautions

- Blanching sometimes also makes some unstable, soluble nutrients in ingredients overflow, especially water-soluble vitamins in fresh vegetables are easier to lose.
- Animal ingredients and plant ingredients should be blanched separately; strong color and taste with light color and taste should be blanched separately; large blocks with small blocks should be blanched separately, to prevent mixing flavors.
- After blanching animal ingredients, soup can be used as fresh soup after skimming foam and clarifying.

### Meat Blanching

- Meat ingredients after boiling water blanching change color then can, scoop out and drain water then can proceed to next cooking.
- Meat after blanching needs to wash off attached blood foam dirt, remember to wash with warm water, otherwise meat expands when hot contracts when cold will adsorb dirt, leading to unable to wash clean blood foam.

### Green Vegetable Blanching
