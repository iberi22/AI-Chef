# Removing Fishy Smell

Removing fishy smell is a process in cooking.

Removing fishy smell refers to removing the fishy or muttony smell from meat, seafood, etc., through means including but not limited to adding seasonings, blanching, etc.

**Fishy smell is the flavor source of some foods, excessive removal may cause food to lose flavor.**

The means of removing fishy smell are diverse, and should be flexibly chosen in cooking.

## Methods

### Adding Seasonings

Adding seasonings to ingredients is the simplest way to remove fishy smell. For example, for most dishes using egg liquid ([Steamed Egg Custard](../../dishes/vegetable_dish/鸡蛋羹/鸡蛋羹.md), [Tomato Scrambled Eggs](../../dishes/vegetable_dish/西红柿炒鸡蛋.md)), salt, cooking wine, vinegar, etc., can be added during the egg liquid preparation to remove fishy smell.

When cooking certain meats, Sichuan pepper, star anise, bay leaves, cinnamon, fennel, chili, etc., can be added to the soup base to remove fishy smell.

Finished spicy hot pot base has extremely rich aroma, can be added in appropriate amount during cooking, enough to cover the fishy smell of most meats.

### Dipping Sauces

Some foods still have strong fishy smell after cooking. Dipping sauces can be prepared to cover the fishy smell when eating.

Common dipping sauce ingredients: vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, bean paste, sweet bean paste, sesame paste, peanut butter, fermented tofu, salt, garlic, ginger, etc.

Various dipping sauce combinations vary, no examples here.

### Sizzling the Wok

During stir-frying, scallions, ginger, garlic, dried chili, etc., can be used to sizzle the wok in the process. The aromatic substances in the seasonings volatilize under high temperature, to a certain extent can cover the fishy smell and increase the flavor of the finished dish.

### Cold Water Pot Blanching

Some animal ingredients have residual blood, such as: chicken, pig trotters, ribs, etc. If the residual blood is not removed, it will cause the finished dish to have a certain fishy smell.

When putting in cold water, the residual blood disperses into the water; as the temperature rises, the protein in the blood coagulates, and the originally dispersed blood forms scum floating on the water surface. At this time, just scoop off the scum to complete removing fishy smell, the remaining clear soup can be used as the soup base for stewing dishes to continue cooking.

### Precautions

- When blanching, often add some seasonings to the pot such as: Sichuan pepper, star anise, cooking wine, scallions, etc., to further strengthen the fishy smell removal
- Star anise has strong aroma, add in moderation
- Sichuan pepper and prickly ash are small in volume but added in large quantities, after adding may remain in the pot or even in the finished dish, can use gauze to wrap a seasoning bag or use food-grade stainless steel seasoning box, convenient to pick out before finishing
