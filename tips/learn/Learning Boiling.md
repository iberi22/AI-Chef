# Learning Boiling

## Process

Pour water into pot——turn on fire, place pot on fire to heat——after water boils (water rolls, lots of bubbles come out) put in ingredients.

### Precautions

* When heating, cover with lid can speed up heating. **But this has risk of boiling over**. After continuous heating, excessively boiling fluid may overflow out of pot, this is boiling over.
* **If about to boil over, immediately turn down fire and open lid.**
* Want to speed up heating and avoid boiling over, can half-open lid, leave gas outlet; also can turn down fire in later stage, and always pay attention to pot situation.
* According to cooking needs, ingredients can also be put in with cold water. But this way water takes longer to boil.
