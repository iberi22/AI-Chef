# Using Microwave Oven

## What is Microwave Oven

Microwave oven was invented in 1945 by [Percy LeBaron Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Spencer).

He was working as a radar system engineer, and because he found that when radar turned on, the chocolate bar in his pocket started melting, thus conceived and invented it.

### Working Method

Microwave produces electromagnetic waves of 2.45 billion Hz frequency through magnetron, this frequency makes water and oil molecules vibrate and heat up.

## Process

Microwave oven is quite effective in many cooking tasks.

High power suitable for:

* [Cooking] Cooking vegetables
* [Cooking] Softening hard vegetables with high water content (such as potatoes, onions and artichokes)
* [Puffing] Popping snacks, such as puffs, Indian papadams, popcorn

Medium power suitable for:

* [Cooking] Seafood (for example [Microwave Scallion Ginger Black Cod](../../dishes/aquatic/微波葱姜黑鳕鱼.md))
* [Cooking] Softening meat
* [Dehydrating] Drying fruit and vegetable peels
* [Dehydrating] Making jerky
* [Frying] Frying crispy spices
* [Frying] Softening leafy vegetables
* [Heating] Heating leftovers

Low power for:

* [Defrosting] Defrosting food
* [Defrosting] Melting butter and chocolate

## Precautions

* Microwave oven should not be used to heat water, this may cause it to superheat, posing a certain impact on your personal safety.
* Absolutely do not use microwave oven to heat eggs! Unless it is **shelled** **raw** egg, and need to pierce the yolk. Because heating will make the gas inside the egg expand, causing explosion.
* No matter what purpose you have, even if you are very curious, you should not use microwave oven to heat whole fruits (such as grapes, blueberries, cherry tomatoes), this may cause them to explode.
* Since microwave wavelength is 12.2 cm, microwave oven heats small objects slower than large objects. So if very small ingredients, suggest gathering together for heating.
* Microwave can only penetrate food a few centimeters, so sometimes outside is very hot, inside may still be icy. Solution is to add a little liquid to ingredients and put in sealed bag, or put in bowl and cover with plastic wrap, let container produce enough steam to compensate for microwave oven's easy uneven cooking disadvantage.
    * Tips: When opening sealed bag, be careful of steam spraying out.
* Microwave can only heat objects containing liquid molecules like water and oil, so plastic wrap and sealed bags will not be heated by microwave.
* Metal can reflect microwave and not be heated, please avoid using containers with gold edges, metal patterns, avoid uneven heating causing container rupture. Must use porcelain, glass containers or microwave oven special trays.
