# Using Air Fryer

## What is Air Fryer

Air fryer is an electronic cooker, using air instead of hot oil to heat, making food cooked, allowing ingredients to achieve similar deep-fry effect without encountering oil.

### Working Method

Air fryer produces high-temperature hot air through the upper heater, letting hot air circulate around the food, quickly heating the food's own oil, taking away the food's moisture, producing deep-fry effect, and creating crispy feel similar to deep-fried food.

### Advantages

* Since no cooking oil added, can **greatly reduce** intake of cooking oil containing high amounts of fat and calories.
* High-speed circulating hot air dehydrates food, surface becomes golden crispy, making food crispy outside tender inside.
* Simple operation, friendly to beginners.

## Process

* Place air fryer on stable, flat and level heat-resistant surface.
* Take out fry pan, put ingredients into fry basket, slide fry pan into product.
* Modify preset temperature, rotate knob to adjust cooking time.
* After adjusting cooking time, product will start cooking, wait for timer to ring when cooking completes.
* Pour all food in fry basket into bowl or plate. Must take out fry basket with ingredients from used fry pan, because fry pan bottom **may have residual hot oil or grease**.

## Precautions

* When using air fryer, note setting temperature not too high (try within 120°C, best not exceed 168°C), making time not too long (about 10 minutes), avoid generating too much harmful ingredients [acrylamide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%99%E7%83%AF%E9%85%B0%E8%83%BA).
* Reduce using air fryer to cook starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, fried dough sticks, etc., can correspondingly reduce [acrylamide](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%99%E7%83%AF%E9%85%B0%E8%83%BA) intake. Relatively, air fryer suitable for cooking foods with higher fat or moisture content, such as meat, vegetables.
* During use, cannot block top air inlet and back air outlet. Covering with hand may be **burned by hot air**.
* Different brand fryer temperature difference can reach ±10°C, first try suggest reduce 10% time then gradually adjust.

### Operation Points

1. **Preprocessing Key**
    - Meat needs fully defrost and wipe dry surface moisture (steak/pork chop suggest room temperature tempering)
    - Frozen foods (fries/pizza) can cook directly, but need increase shake/flip frequency

2. **Anti-Stick Techniques**
    - Fish/cake etc. easy stick foods suggest line with parchment or foil
    - Fry basket bottom can lay onion slices/lemon slices to enhance flavor and isolate juices

3. **Coloring Control**
    - Last 2-3 minutes adjust high 10-20°C can make surface more crispy (applicable to fries/chicken wings)
    - Egg tarts/cakes surface cover with foil can prevent over-char

4. **Doneness Detection**
    - Meat: Press with chopsticks, firm is well-done, soft with elasticity is medium
    - Cake: Toothpick insert center no batter sticking then done
