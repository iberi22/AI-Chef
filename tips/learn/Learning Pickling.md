# Learning Pickling (Meat)

## Note

The pickling described here is the step of processing ingredients before cooking, not making salted meat or pickled sausages, etc.

## Pickling

Pickling meat before cooking is a common method to let meat pre-absorb flavor. Generally, the object of pickling is raw meat. According to the needs of the dish, you can determine the size of meat cutting yourself.

For example, fried chicken popcorn, chicken breast is cut into dice-sized small pieces and put in bowl to pickle.
For example, roast whole lamb, lamb leg, half or whole lamb meat does not need to cut, can coat surface with lots of seasonings to pickle flavor.

Depending on the dish, the seasonings and auxiliary ingredients for pickling can be any kind. Sometimes for different tastes, auxiliary ingredients may also need pre-processing.

## Basic Concepts of Pickling

Here introduced is the normal taste pickling process.

- Generally, the larger the meat amount (such as pickling 5kg chicken wings at once), the larger the volume (such as a whole lamb leg), the heavier the taste, the more seasonings and auxiliary ingredients needed.
- Generally, the longer the planned pickling time, the less seasonings and auxiliary ingredients used.
- When pickling, seasonings should evenly cover all surfaces. If meat slices, meat shreds, should use hands to mix evenly as much as possible. If whole lamb leg, should use hands or brush to brush evenly on surface.
- Generally, stir-fried meat, fried meat need advance pickling. Stir-fried meat should ensure tender taste, cooking often needs high fire and short time. When short cooking time is not easy to flavor, advance pickling can make up for taste deficiency.

## Pickling Techniques

- Fine meat shreds, thin meat slices: Since meat is fragile, need to be as gentle as possible. Fingers in claw machine shape, lightly mix seasonings. Then gently stir in one direction.
- Meat shreds, meat slices, meat chunks: Same technique, but force can be a bit stronger.
- Chicken legs, chicken wings size: First make several flower cuts on ingredients. Chicken wing roots, chicken legs can pierce holes with knife. Then mix seasonings in bowl first, then put ingredients in seasoning bowl to coat evenly.
- Lamb leg size: Generally can pierce holes in thicker meat parts. Then mix seasonings and evenly coat on ingredient surface.

## Pickling Containers and Time

- Choose container that can hold ingredients and seasonings. Including bowls, plates, trays, etc. At this time is open pickling, generally short time, common 0.5-2 hours pickling time. (Roast) lamb leg etc. can also pickle this way, but time longer.
- Can choose large enough food ziplock bag to pickle. At this time is sealed pickling, generally long time, such as overnight pickling, or pickling hard-to-flavor ribs, etc. Common 4 hours-overnight. At this time use less seasonings, prevent finished dish too heavy too salty.

## Commonly Used Pickling Ingredients

- Light soy sauce: Adjust soy aroma and salty base flavor. Can be used for almost all meats.
- Dark soy sauce: Salty flavor not strong, but easy to color. Used to adjust base color and enhance aroma. Generally should not use large amounts to prevent bean fishy smell. Can be used for almost all red meats (less used), pig liver can add more.
- Salt: Salty but after stir-frying no soy aroma. Can be used for all meats.
- White (granulated) sugar: Adjust sweet taste (large amount), can also add tender taste to meat (small amount). Can be used for all poultry livestock meats, but fish and seafood not commonly used.
- Brown sugar: Adjust sweet taste and brown sugar special taste, taste slightly heavier than white sugar. Can be used for almost all meats (generally meat color darker or finished dish color darker).
- Oyster sauce: Add fresh, salty, sweet taste. Generally used for red meat.
- White vinegar/rice vinegar: Add sour taste. Less used.
- Aged vinegar/aromatic vinegar: Not only sour taste, but also enhance aroma and color for dish. Aromatic vinegar more suitable for dark fish (especially grilled fish).
- Cooking wine: Remove fishy enhance aroma. Can be used for almost all meats. But need to note:
  - Cooking wine itself very strong flavor, easy to mask ingredient own aroma, for not strong fishy ingredients, can consider not using cooking wine to remove fishy. For example: beef, fish, chicken.
  - For chicken, can use white wine instead of cooking wine.
  - For beef, can use ginger scallion water instead of cooking wine.
  - For white fish, just need to clean blood threads and mucous membrane, no fishy smell, suggest not add cooking wine.
- Yellow wine: Remove fishy enhance aroma, effect better than cooking wine, aroma more complex than cooking wine. Generally used for white meat. Red meat also can, but effect similar to cooking wine.
- Five-spice powder/thirteen spice: Add aroma to meat, simplest compound spice. Five-spice powder only add aroma, thirteen spice aroma unique, identifiable. Use such spices should control amount. Can be used for almost all meats, but fish and seafood not commonly used.
- Chili powder: Chili powder divided into many kinds. Not talking chili types, from grinding fineness divided into chili powder/chili noodles, chili pieces, etc. Besides adding spicy to meat, can color finished dish. Dishes pickled with chili should avoid chili excess. Can be used for almost all meats needing spicy base flavor, but cooking time should slightly control, prevent chili taste bitter, or color darken.
- Cumin powder, fennel powder: Generally use ground powder as pickle, not granules, so meat easier to flavor. Can be used for almost all red meat and chicken.
- X pepper powder: Add pungent, spicy, aromatic, numbing taste to meat. Use should be moderate, prevent covering other tastes.
  - Black pepper powder: Taste pungent, spicy. Can be used for almost all red meat.
  - White pepper powder: Taste pungent, aromatic. Slightly weaker than black pepper, highlight aroma. Can be used for almost all meats.

- Scallion ginger garlic: Scallion ginger remove fishy enhance aroma, remove off-flavor; garlic add pungent aroma. Scallion can cut segments or slices as needed; ginger generally slice, some scenes need peel; garlic can slice or chop. If scallion ginger not want in finished dish, or taste need lighter, can put scallion ginger pieces in bowl with very little water, squeeze juice, use scallion ginger water to pickle meat. Garlic generally not directly add. Can be used for all meats.
- Seafood sauce, shrimp paste, etc.: Add fresh, salty taste to meat. Seafood sauce taste sweetish, shrimp paste taste heavy. Can be used for almost all meats, but usage scenes not many.
- Fermented black beans: Add fermented bean aroma and salty taste to meat. Can be used for almost all red meats, but not used much.
- Starch: That is cornstarch. Starch is important pickle for coating. Thicker coating, or need more tender taste, more starch needed. Can be used for almost all meats. `Starch can be used as simple deep-fry coating (generally need add flour etc. as needed), at this time generally not add during pickling`.
  - Cornstarch, potato starch: Viscosity generally maximum.
  - Sweet potato starch: Viscosity slightly lower.
- Oil: Add appropriate oil during pickling for oil seal, can lock moisture and flavor. If use open container pickling, and time long (such as in bowl), oil seal can greatly ensure meat not dry or tough. Can be used for almost all meats. After oil seal, stir-fry should slightly reduce base oil, deep-fry no difference.
