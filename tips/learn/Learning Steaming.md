# Learning Steaming

## Methods

### Steamer

Steamer is multi-layer structure, bottom layer for holding water, using heat from steam produced after water boils to heat upper layer food.

Add appropriate water to steamer bottom layer——put food in upper steamer basket——place steamer on fire to heat.

### Wok

If no steamer, only ordinary wok (not flat bottom), can place a trivet at bottom, and inject enough water, to achieve similar to steamer effect.

Add sufficient water to wok bottom——put in trivet——place food on trivet——turn on fire cover.

## Precautions

* Since heat source is steam, food in lower steamer basket bottom may be soaked by water. Can place steamer cloth under food to avoid this. Using chopsticks to make simple stand for food also can.
* Can use smart device set timer, remind to turn off fire, prevent forgetting and burning dry.
* When using steamer to make food, need to pay attention to remaining water amount in bottom area, **especially wok**, avoid dry pot causing safety issues.
* (Optional) When using wok to steam food, can place a steam plate above trivet.
