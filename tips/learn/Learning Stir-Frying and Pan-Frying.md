# Stir-Frying/Pan-Frying

## Utensils

Ordinary metal (iron/stainless steel/aluminum) wok or non-stick pan can be used.

Aluminum containers are not recommended, reasons see food safety section.

### Precautions

* Methods to make ordinary pan non-stick when stir-frying:

#### Fry Egg First Method

* No matter what dish you fry, fry an egg first, don't wash the pan after frying, the next dish won't stick.

#### Hot Pan Cold Oil Method

* Remember it must be hot pan cold oil, first heat the pan.
  * Clean pan put nothing, dry burn, make it heat evenly, heat up.
  * Put in cold oil, rotate the pan, make oil coat the whole pan (can rotate back and forth to heat evenly).
  * When you see gas coming out of the pan, it means the pan's oil is heated.
  * Pour out the oil, don't wash the pan after pouring out.
  * Can repeat the above steps 2-3 times for better non-stick effect.
  * Note: If gas, may spout fire, pay attention to safety.

#### Hot Pan Double Oil Method

* First heat the pan.
  * Clean pan put nothing, dry burn, make it heat evenly, heat up.
  * Put in "small amount of cold oil", rotate the pan, make oil coat the whole pan (can rotate back and forth to heat evenly).
  * When you see gas coming out of the pan, it means the pan's oil is heated.
  * Then continue to put in cold oil, start stir-frying.
  * Note: If gas, may spout fire, pay attention to safety.

Supplement:

* The purpose is to make oil coat the pan bottom, all household pans on the market are applicable, after coating oil, instantly become non-stick pan.
* Using non-stick pan to fry food won't stick. The function of non-stick pan comes from the coating on its inner wall. **Metal spatula will scratch the coating. When using non-stick pan, use wooden or silicone spatula to avoid damaging the coating.**

### Process

Turn on fire——directly place pan flat on fire, heat up——pour oil into pan, heat up——put in ingredients, stir-fry——remember to add seasonings before taking out.

### Precautions

* When judging if pan/oil is heated, can place hand flat above the pan to feel the heat; only after oil is hot can put in ingredients.
* Before pouring oil into pan, must confirm there is no residual water inside the pan. **Water will cause hot oil to splash, causing danger.**
* Following the above, before putting ingredients into oil pan, should drain water (egg liquid is fine); similarly, cannot put unfrozen ingredients into oil pan, to avoid danger after ice melts.
* **If oil pan catches fire, never pour water to extinguish**. This will expand the fire. When fire just starts, can quickly turn off fire, cover with lid.
