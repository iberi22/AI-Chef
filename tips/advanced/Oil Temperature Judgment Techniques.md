# Oil Temperature Judgment Techniques and Common Temperature and Unit Conversion Table

* Oil temperature between 120°C-140°C: Suitable for soft frying[^1], stir-frying[^2]. Put chopsticks into the oil pot, basically no bubbles around, no blue smoke, no sound, oil temperature calm.
* Oil temperature between 150°C-160°C: Optimal cooking temperature. Put chopsticks into the oil pot, a few oil bubbles will emerge around, slight blue smoke, oil rolls from the sides to the center.
* Oil temperature between 160°C-180°C: Suitable for coloring and crisping. Put chopsticks into the oil pot, large amount of blue smoke rises, oil surface is relatively calm.
* (Note) It is best to buy an oil temperature gun, use thermometer cautiously.

> The so-called "n percent oil temperature" in online video tutorials refers to relative to ten percent oil temperature, which is 300°C.
> That is, n percent oil temperature T_n = 30n [degree Celsius]
> Temperature conversion formula
> C = 5/9 *(F - 32)
> or
> F = 9/5*C + 32

* ^1: Soft frying is an oil frying method where small pieces, slices or strips of material are battered, put into the oil pot, and fried to about seventy to eighty percent done.
* ^2: Stir-frying, select tender animal raw materials cut into shreds, slices, cubes, strips, etc., coat with egg white and starch, slide in warm oil, pour into colander to drain excess oil
