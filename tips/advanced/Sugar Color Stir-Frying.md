# Sugar Color Stir-Frying

Principle: Sugar melts when heated, and presents different states after heating for different times.

Taking stir-frying 200ml sugar color as an example.

## Water Stir-Frying

1. Take a pot with **curved bottom** or **flat bottom area less than 1/3**.

2. Add 8g rock sugar, white sugar or cotton sugar to the pot, rock sugar is preferred, if you want the sugar color sweeter, you can increase by about 2g.

3. Add 50ml 70°C hot water to the pot.

4. Place the pot on the stove.

5. If using gas stove, adjust the fire from large to small to minimum, so that the flame range does not exceed the water surface area. If using induction cooker, turn to minimum, and be ready to turn off the power at any time.

6. Use the spatula to continuously stir the sugar water mixture. If it is rock sugar, you can use the back or edge of the spatula to gently tap to crush to accelerate melting. During this process, if the sugar has not melted but has started to change color, you need to continue adding hot water to 50ml.

7. After the sugar is completely melted, the sugar water mixture presents a viscous state and the color is transparent white, like mica color. At this time, continue stirring.

8. Continue stirring the sugar water mixture, the color of the sugar water mixture gradually presents white.

9. Continue stirring the sugar water mixture, the color of the sugar water mixture begins to appear light brown.

10. Continue stirring the sugar water mixture, the brown color of the sugar water mixture is very obvious.

11. Continue stirring the sugar water mixture, the sugar water mixture is brown and appears dense bubbles.

12. Continue stirring the sugar water mixture, the sugar water mixture is brown and appears dense bubbles, and larger bubbles appear in the dense small bubbles.

13. Add 150ml 70°C hot water to the pot. At this time, the liquid in the pot presents deep red-brown color, transparent and clear, with a faint caramel flavor.

14. Pour into a bowl, obtain 200ml sugar color.
