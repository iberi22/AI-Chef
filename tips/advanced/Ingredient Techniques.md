# Ingredient Techniques

* The order of adding auxiliary ingredients is basically as follows: First put ginger, then put scallion and garlic, chili, then put dry ingredients (star anise/peppercorns/Sichuan pepper), then put dried chili. For each of the above steps, depending on the dish being made, unnecessary auxiliary ingredients can be removed from the queue.
* Ginger has the highest water content, which means we need more time to stir-fry out the ginger juice.
* If you are using scallion segments (scallion segments are best smashed twice with a kitchen knife), then I recommend putting in the scallion segments first, then the garlic pieces. If you are using scallion flowers, then these two auxiliary ingredients can be put in the pot together. Note: The juice in scallion segments is harder to stir-fry out.
* If you are making stir-fried dishes, I recommend putting in the dry ingredients before putting in the ginger, this can make the oil more flavorful, so that the fried dishes are more fragrant. Why not do this for stewed dishes, braised dishes, because you may need to stir-fry a lot of auxiliary ingredients, so that the stir-frying time of auxiliary ingredients is too long, causing the dry ingredients to turn black and bitter.
* Dried chili is put last because dried chili easily turns black due to the pot temperature, dried chili only needs to be stir-fried for a few seconds.
* Note: No matter what cuisine you like to make, stir-frying these auxiliary ingredients to golden brown on low heat can make the whole dish more fragrant, which is something seasonings cannot provide.

## Salt Timing and Salt Amount Control

* For quick stir-fry dishes, add salt first, salt amount = total ingredient weight x 0.9%;
* For meat dishes, add salt when 80% cooked, salt amount = (total ingredient weight + 30mL juice) x (1～1.2%);
* For soup dishes, add salt at the end, salt amount = initial water amount x 0.8%.
* Daily total salt intake is not recommended to exceed 5g, refer to [WHO](https://www.who.int/zh/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/salt-reduction)
